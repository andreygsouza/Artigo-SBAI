abstract = {This letter proposes a driver identification algorithm developed for using minimal information transmitted in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) environment based on the assumption that each driver has his/her own unique driving behavior characteristics hidden in conventional driving behaviour signals. Performance evaluation using real-world data shows that the proposed algorithm accurately identifies three drivers in 15 trips using only two acceleration signals at a sampling rate much lower than the one used in previous study. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to perform driver identification within a small connectivity time in a scenario where driving behavior signals of are transmitted via a V2V communication environment in a streaming manner.},

abstract = {Advancements in biometrics-based authentication have led to its increasing prominence and are being incorporated into everyday tasks. Existing vehicle security systems rely only on alarms or smart card as forms of protection. A biometric driver recognition system utilizing driving behaviors is a highly novel and personalized approach and could be incorporated into existing vehicle security system to form a multimodal identification system and offer a greater degree of multilevel protection. In this paper, detailed studies have been conducted to model individual driving behavior in order to identify features that may be efficiently and effectively used to profile each driver. Feature extraction techniques based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are proposed and implemented. Features extracted from the accelerator and brake pedal pressure were then used as inputs to a fuzzy neural network (FNN) system to ascertain the identity of the driver. Two fuzzy neural networks, namely, the evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN) and the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), are used to demonstrate the viability of the two proposed feature extraction techniques. The performances were compared against an artificial neural network (NN) implementation using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and a statistical method based on the GMM. Extensive testing was conducted and the results show great potential in the use of the FNN for real-time driver identification and verification. In addition, the profiling of driver behaviors has numerous other potential applications for use by law enforcement and companies dealing with buses and truck drivers. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

Mining driving characteristics or habits from numerous travel data to identify drivers is the Driver Identification topic concerned in this paper. Real data sets are collected, including GPS, Acceleration and Angular Velocity. Some Deep Learning algorithms, such as AlexNet and Recurrent Neural Network, are novelly applied to solve the problem. Moreover, their performance are compared with Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest in Machine Learning. In addition, drawing on the idea of speech recognition, Dynamic Time Warping is applied to find common track sections as verification set for Deep Learning identifications, which is a brand new crossover application. The overall designed identification process is tested by experiments, in which 5,500,000 driving records for each of 25 drivers are collected, and accuracy, precision, recall, verification rate and speed are consided as perfomances. The results show that Deep Learning are feasible for the problem and the two algorithms have different advantages. Especially, the testing accuracy of AlexNet is 46.15{\%}, and the DTW verification accuracy can reach 67.77{\%}.

abstract = {All drivers have habits behind the wheel. Different drivers vary in how they hit the gas and brake pedals, how they turn the steering wheel, and how much following distance they keep to follow a vehicle safely and comfortably. In this paper, we model such driving behaviors as car-following and pedal operation patterns. The relationship between following distance and velocity mapped into a two-dimensional space is modeled for each driver with an optimal velocity model approximated by a nonlinear function or with a statistical method of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Pedal operation patterns are also modeled with GMMs that represent the distributions of raw pedal operation signals or spectral features extracted through spectral analysis of the raw pedal operation signals. The driver models are evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle. Experimental results show that the driver model based on the spectral features of pedal operation signals efficiently models driver individual differences and achieves an identification rate of 76.8{\%} for a field test with 276 drivers, resulting in a relative error reduction of 55{\%} over driver models that use raw pedal operation signals without spectral analysis},

abstract = {The majority of fatal car crashes are caused by reckless driving. With the sophistication of vehicle instrumentation, reckless maneuvers, such as abrupt turns, acceleration, and deceleration, can now be accurately detected by analyzing data related to the driver-vehicle interactions. Such analysis usually requires very specific in-vehicle hardware and infrastructure sensors (e.g. loop detectors and radars), which can be costly. Hence, in this paper, we investigated if off-the-shelf smartphones can be used to online detect and classify the driver's behavior in near real-time. To do so, we first modeled and performed an intrinsic evaluation to assess the performance of three outlier detection algorithms formulated as a data stream processing network which receives as input and processes data streams of smartphone and vehicle sensors. Next, we implemented a novel scoring mechanism based on online outlier detection to quantitatively evaluate drivers' maneuvers as either cautious or reckless. Thus, we adapted a data mining mechanism which takes into account a sensor's data rates and power to determine driver behavior in the scoring process. Finally, as the intrinsic evaluation does not necessarily reveal how well an algorithm will perform in a real-world scenario, we evaluated the algorithm that achieved the best result in a real-world case study to assess drivers' driving behavior. Our results indicate that the algorithm performs quickly and accurately; the algorithm classifies driver behavior with 95.45{\%} accuracy. Moreover, such results are obtained within 100 milliseconds of processing time on average.},

Unlike traditional anomaly detection methods, we propose a special feature extraction method based on transfer probability of Markov chain, so as to deep mining information of the raw time series. Firstly, time series is transformed into forms of Markov chain by a simple rule. Then, the transfer probability matrix of Markov chain can be calculated, we name it as Markov feature. Importantly, key parameters occurred during process of features extraction will be studied. And then, taking the extracted Markov feature and two simple statistical features(mean and variance) as the feature vector. Last, to verify effectiveness of the proposed method, we use four machine learning methods(i.e. k-NN, RF, DT and SVM) and oil pipeline pressure data in experiment section. Meanwhile, comparatives between the proposed features extraction with other three methods are done. Experimental results show that the proposed anomaly detection method is more accurate and effective.},

In this paper, we show that it can be well solved with deep learning and using both face identification and verification signals as supervision. The Deep IDentification-verification features (DeepID2) are learned with carefully designed deep convolutional networks. The face identification task increases the inter-personal variations by drawing DeepID2 extracted from different identities apart, while the face verification task reduces the intra-personal variations by pulling DeepID2 extracted from the same identity together, both of which are essential to face recognition. The learned DeepID2 features can be well generalized to new identities unseen in the training data. On the challenging LFW dataset [11], 99.15{\%} face verification accuracy is achieved.

Although face recognition performance sky-rocketed using deep-learning in classic datasets like LFW, leading to the belief that this technique reached human performance, it still remains an open problem in unconstrained environments as demonstrated by the newly released IJB datasets. This survey aims to summarize the main advances in deep face recognition and, more in general, in learning face representations for verification and identification. The survey provides a clear, structured presentation of the principal, state-of-the-art (SOTA) face recognition techniques appearing within the past five years in top computer vision venues. The survey is broken down into multiple parts that follow a standard face recognition pipeline: (a) how SOTA systems are trained and which public data sets have they used; (b) face preprocessing part (detection, alignment, etc.); (c) architecture and loss functions used for transfer learning (d) face recognition for verification and identification. The survey concludes with an overview of the SOTA results at a glance along with some open issues currently overlooked by the community.},

abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that driver distraction is a leading cause of vehicle crashes and incidents. In particular, increased use of so-called in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) and partially autonomous driving assistance systems (PADAS) have raised important and growing safety concerns. Thus, detecting the driver's state is of paramount importance, to adapt IVIS and PADAS accordingly, therefore avoiding or mitigating their possible negative effects. The purpose of this paper is to show a method for the nonintrusive and real-time detection of visual distraction, using vehicle dynamics data and without using the eye-tracker data as inputs to classifiers. Specifically, we present and compare different models that are based on well-known machine learning (ML) methods. Data for training the models were collected using a static driving simulator, with real human subjects performing a specific secondary task [i.e., a surrogate visual research task (SURT)] while driving. Different training methods, model characteristics, and feature selection criteria have been compared. Based on our results, using a support vector machine (SVM) has outperformed all the other ML methods, providing the highest classification rate for most of the subjects. Potential applications of this paper include the design of an adaptive IVIS and of a “smarter” PADAS.},

abstract = {Detection of driver aggressiveness is a significant method in terms of safe driving. Every year, a vast number of traffic accidents occur due to aggressive driving behaviour. These traffic accidents cause fatalities, severe disorders and huge economical cost. Therefore, detection of driver aggressiveness could help in reducing the number of traffic accidents by warning related authorities to take necessary precautions. In this work, a novel method is introduced in order to detect driver aggressiveness on vehicle. The proposed method is based on the fusion of visual and sensor features to characterize related driving session and to decide whether the session involves aggressive driving behaviour. Visual information is used to detect road lines and vehicle images, whereas sensor information provides data such as vehicle speed and engine speed. Both information is used to obtain feature vectors which represent a driving session. These feature vectors are obtained by modelling time series data by Gaussian distributions. An SVM classifier is utilized to classify the feature vectors in order for aggressiveness decision. The proposed system is tested by real traffic data, and it achieved an aggressive driving detection rate of 93.1 {\%}.},

Currently, there is a need for individualization of advanced DAS with the aim of improving safety, security and comfort of the driver. In particular, the need to adapt the vehicle to individual preferences and requirements of the driver is an important research focus. In this work, an individualized and non-intrusive monitoring system for real-time driver support is proposed. The kernel of the system is a driver identification module based on driving behavior signals and a high-performance machine learning technique. The scheme is suitable for the development of single-chip embedded systems. Moreover, most of the measurement units used in this research are nowadays available in commercial vehicles, so the deployment of the system can be performed with minimal additional cost. Experimental results using a reduced set of features are very encouraging. Identification rates greater than 75{\%} are obtained for a working set of 11 drivers, 86{\%} for five-driver groups, 88{\%} for four-driver groups, and 90{\%} for three-driver groups.},

Therefore, researchers have been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support vehicular ad hoc network's (VANET's) primary aim of safe driving. We call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the last five years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive compilation, including used features, classification methods, accuracy rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as tables to highlight the (dis)advantages and/or limitations of the aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the methods used for the detection of driver distraction.},

abstract = {Reduced insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has been associated with longevity in various model organisms. However, the role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in human survival remains controversial. The aim of this study was to test whether circulating IGF-1 axis parameters associate with old age survival and functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study. This study examined 858 Dutch nonagenarian (males≥89 years; females≥91 years) siblings from 409 families, without selection on health or demographic characteristics. Nonagenarians were divided over sex-specific strata according to their levels of IGF-1, IGF binding protein 3 and IGF-1/IGFBP3 molar ratio. We found that lower IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratios were associated with improved survival: nonagenarians in the quartile of the lowest ratio had a lower estimated hazard ratio (95{\%} confidence interval) of 0.73 (0.59 – 0.91) compared to the quartile with the highest ratio (ptrend=0.002). Functional status was assessed by (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living ((I)ADL) scales. Compared to those in the quartile with the highest IGF-1/IGFBP3 ratio, nonagenarians in the lowest quartile had higher scores for ADL (ptrend=0.001) and IADL (ptrend=0.003). These findings suggest that IGF-1 axis parameters are associated with increased old age survival and better functional status in nonagenarians from the Leiden Longevity Study.},

abstract = {A sequential injection system which consists of a syringe pump, a selector valve, a multi-port valve, a gas-liquid separator and a solenoid valve for the determination of arsenic by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry using tetrahydroborate as reductant was developed. The reduction time of sample with tetrahydoborate has increased by keeping the reactant in gas-liquid separator by using the solenoid valve. Various parameters affecting the performance of the sequential injection system were optimized, including reaction-time, carrier gas flow, sample volume, tetrahydroborate volume and concentration. Established sequential injection hydride generation technique was simple and automated operation. A sample throughput of 112/h was achieved with 400 $\mu$L samples with a precision of 2.0{\%} RSD at 4 $\mu$g/L As (n = 10) and a detection limit of 0.09 $\mu$g/L. Good agreement with the certified values was obtained for the determination of arsenic in standard reference materials.},

abstract = {We present a method for training a similarity metric from data. The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the ¢ ¤ {\pounds} norm in the target space approximates the "semantic" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlu-sions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves.},

We present a deep convolutional architecture with layers specially designed to address the problem of re-identification. Given a pair of images as input, our network outputs a similarity value indicating whether the two input images depict the same person. Novel elements of our architecture include a layer that computes cross-input neighborhood differences, which capture local relationships between the two input images based on mid- level features from each input image. A high-level summary of the outputs of this layer is computed by a layer of patch summary features, which are then spatially integrated in subsequent layers. Our method significantly outperforms the state of the art on both a large data set (CUHK03) and a medium-sized data set (CUHK01), and is resistant to over- fitting. We also demonstrate that by initially training on an unrelated large data set before fine-tuning on a small target data set, our network can achieve results comparable to the state of the art even on a small data set (VIPeR). 1.},

This emerging technique has reshaped the research landscape of face recognition since 2014, launched by the breakthroughs of Deepface and DeepID methods. Since then, deep face recognition (FR) technique, which leverages the hierarchical architecture to learn discriminative face representation, has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art performance and fostered numerous successful real-world applications. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the recent developments on deep FR, covering the broad topics on algorithms, data, and scenes. First, we summarize different network architectures and loss functions proposed in the rapid evolution of the deep FR methods. Second, the related face processing methods are categorized into two classes: `one-to-many augmentation' and `many-to-one normalization'. Then, we summarize and compare the commonly used databases for both model training and evaluation. Third, we review miscellaneous scenes in deep FR, such as cross-factor, heterogenous, multiple-media and industry scenes. Finally, potential deficiencies of the current methods and several future directions are highlighted.},

In this paper, we study Siamese networks from a new perspective and question the validity of their training procedure. We show that in the majority of cases, the objective of a Siamese network is endowed with an invariance property. Neglecting the invariance property leads to a hindrance in training the Siamese networks. To alleviate this issue, we propose two Riemannian structures and generalize a well-established accelerated stochastic gradient descent method to take into account the proposed Riemannian structures. Our empirical evaluations suggest that by making use of the Riemannian geometry, state-of-the-art performances can be achieved for the challenging problem of fine-grained image classification.},

Existing work on diierentiating drivers largely relies on devices that drivers carry, or on the locations that drivers visit to distinguish drivers. Internally, however, the vehicle processes a much richer set of sensor informa-tion that is becoming increasingly available to external services. To explore how easily drivers can be distinguished from such data, we consider a system that interfaces to the vehicle bus and executes supervised or unsupervised driver diierentiation techniques on this data. To facilitate this analysis and to evaluate the system, we collect in-vehicle data from 24 drivers on a controlled campus test route, as well as 480 trips over three weeks from mve shared uni-versity mail vans. We also conduct studies between members of a family. .e results show that driver diierentiation does not require longer sequences of driving telemetry data but can be accomplished with 91{\%} accuracy within 20s aaer the driver enters the vehicle, usually even before the vehicle starts moving.},

This keyless auto-theft attack will be increased as cars adopt computerized electronic devices more. To detect auto-theft efficiently, we propose the driver verification method that analyzes driving patterns using measurements from the sensor in the vehicle. In our model, we add mechanical features of automotive parts that are excluded in previous works, but can be differentiated by drivers' driving behaviors. We design the model that uses significant features through feature selection to reduce the time cost of feature processing and improve the detection performance. Further, we enrich the feature set by deriving statistical features such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This minimizes the effect of fluctuation of feature values per driver and finally generates the reliable model. We also analyze the effect of the size of sliding window on performance to detect the time point when the detection becomes reliable and to inform owners the theft event as soon as possible. We apply our model with real driving and show the contribution of our work to the literature of driver identification.},

In this work, a set of behavioral features extracted by a car monitoring system is proposed to realize driver identification and path kind identification and to evaluate driver's familiarity with a given vehicle.

abstract = {SETTING: The incidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is surprisingly high among certain subgroups of patients in industrialized countries. Diagnosis is often difficult and can require costly invasive workup. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is a safe, minimally invasive, accurate, out-patient diagnostic modality for assessing mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenopathy and masses. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of EUS-FNA for diagnosing EPTB. DESIGN: Retrospective 6-year review, including all patients who had evidence of lymphadenopathy or mass on computed tomography scan accessible by EUS and consideration of tuberculosis (TB) in the differential diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 81 potential patients, a total of 20 cases with EPTB diagnosed by EUS-FNA were identified. Necrotizing granulomas had a 58{\%} likelihood of TB vs. 14{\%} for other cytologic findings (P {\textless} 0.0001); necrosis was also predictive, with a 44{\%} likelihood of TB vs. 19{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0225). EUS-FNA cytology was diagnostic for TB when an African-born patient had necrotizing granulomas (P {\textless} 0.0001), and was highly suggestive with necrosis alone (P {\textless} 0.0514). Non-necrotizing granulomas were not predictive of TB and an alternative diagnosis was more likely, including sarcoidosis and cancer. CONCLUSION: EUS-FNA is a useful diagnostic modality that should be used early in the diagnostic workup of suspected EPTB.},

For this reason, automatic identification of a driver from among a group of various drivers (i.e. real-time driver identification) is a key factor in the development of ADAS, mainly when the driver's comfort and security is also to be taken into account. The main focus of this work is the development of embedded electronic systems for in-vehicle deployment of driver identification models. We developed a hybrid model based on artificial neural networks (ANN), and cepstral feature extraction techniques, able to recognize the driving style of different drivers. Results obtained show that the system is able to perform real-time driver identification using non-intrusive driving behavior signals such as brake pedal signals and gas pedal signals. The identification of a driver from within groups with a reduced number of drivers yields promising identification rates (e.g. 3-driver group yield 84.6 {\%}). However, real-time development of ADAS requires very fast electronic systems. To this end, an FPGA-based hardware coprocessor for acceleration of the neural classifier has been developed. The coprocessor core is able to compute the whole ANN in less than 4 $\mu$s.},

The performance of the system is evaluated on the basis of groups of different number of known drivers, and possible impostor drivers.

abstract = {? 2015 IEEE.This paper presents a novel methodology for driver identification using hidden characteristics in the variance of acceleration data of the target vehicles. The proposed method is based on the use of raw acceleration data of moving vehicles collected from mobile devices such as smartphone which provides an easy access solution in comparison to existing approaches based on bio-sensors, cameras and steering wheel movements. Results from the analysis showed that the proposed driver identification method can tell the relationship of the acceleration data of each driver and lead to guidelines to distinguish the driving habits of each motorist.},
